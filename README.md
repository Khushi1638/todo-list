# To-Do List

This is a basic **To-Do List** web page that allows users to add tasks dynamically and mark them as complete. Although it's still a work in progress, the functionality includes adding tasks and marking them as complete with a simple toggle. A feature for removing tasks after they are marked as complete is being worked on.

## Overview

### The Challenge

This project was created to practice JavaScript functionality and enhance my understanding of DOM manipulation. The initial goal was to create a functional to-do list that:

1. Allows users to add tasks dynamically.
2. Marks tasks as complete when clicked.
3. Includes a feature to remove tasks once marked complete.

## My Process

### Code Example ðŸ“Œ

Hereâ€™s a snippet of how I dynamically add tasks to the list:

```javascript
const addNewItem = () => {
  let valueOfTask = tasks.value;
  
  // Check if the input value is not empty
  if(valueOfTask) {
    let listItem = document.createElement("li");
    let icon = document.createElement("i");
    icon.className = "fa-regular fa-circle icon";
    listItem.appendChild(icon);
    listItem.appendChild(document.createTextNode(" " + valueOfTask));
    items.appendChild(listItem);
    tasks.value = "";
  } else {
    alert("Please enter an item.");
  }
}

btn.addEventListener("click", addNewItem);
```

### Built With
- **HTML**: To structure the page and the input elements.
- **CSS**: For basic styling of the page and layout.
- **JavaScript**: To add dynamic functionalities like adding tasks, marking them as complete, and handling events efficiently.

### What I Learned

During the development of this project, I learned several important concepts:

1. **Adding Elements Dynamically**: I used JavaScript to create new HTML elements (tasks) dynamically and append them to the DOM.
2. **Event Delegation**: I applied event delegation to handle events on dynamically added elements, which helped me manage interactions more efficiently.like:
```javasrcript
items.addEventListener("click", function(evt) {
  if(evt.target.classList.contains("dynamic-item")) {
    evt.target.style.textDecoration = "line-through";
  }
});
```
3. **Event Bubbling**: I learned about event bubbling and how events propagate from child elements to their parent elements.
4. **Toggling Task Completion**: Implemented functionality where clicking on a task toggles its completion by adding a strikethrough effect.
5. **Accessibility**: Added ARIA attributes and improved accessibility for users with disabilities. This includes using aria-label and     visibility-hidden classes for better screen reader compatibility.

### **Key Improvements**
1. Task Editing: I added a feature to allow users to edit tasks by double-clicking on them. Users can update the task text without having to delete and re-add it.
2. Keyboard Accessibility: Enabled users to add tasks and save edits using the Enter key, improving the overall user experience.
Clear All Button: Added functionality to clear all tasks at once, resetting the app with one click.
Improved Accessibility: Focused on making the app more accessible by using ARIA attributes and ensuring better screen reader compatibility.

### Continued Development

The current version of the To-Do list has two primary features:
1. Dynamically adding tasks to the list.
2. Toggling a "completed" state when clicking on a task.
3. Added a **Remove** icon to delete tasks after they are marked as complete.
4.  Store tasks in **localStorage** so the to-do list persists across page reloads.
5. Added the **Clear All** button to delete the all task and also remove it from the local storage.
6. Added some features to enhance accessibility.
7. Added the functionality to sort the taks in alphabatical and in important.
8. Added the drag and drop API to the list items.

In the next iteration, I plan to:
- Make the design **more visually appealing** and **responsive** for mobile use.
- Add the due date for the tasks.
- Adding the category to tasks.
- Adding the sorting functionality to sort them as completed, not completed.
